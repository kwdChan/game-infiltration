# Video game: Infiltration 
My first video game using the game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). 

## Main Idea
- The enemys come from the top and walk down at some random intervals
- The player's goal is to move up to the enemy's base
- The player should avoid the enemys' eyesights and can kill them
- There are soldiers from the player's side moving up that can be killed by the enemys. 
- The player get more scores per second if there're more soldiers on the screen 

## Status 
- Used free assets for character arts
- Randomise enemy moving speed and vision range

## To be implemented 
- Soldiers
- Randomise spawn timing

- Background art
  
## Other Ideas
- More player Skills
- Soldier actions
- Enemy towers
- Checkpoints and mini-bosses
